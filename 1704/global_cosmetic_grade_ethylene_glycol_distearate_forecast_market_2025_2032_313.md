</p><p><strong>Ethylene Glycol Distearate (EGDS) is a chemical compound produced through the esterification of stearic acid with ethylene glycol. It is typically a mixture of mono- and di-esters and is known for its pearlescent appearance, making it a popular additive in cosmetic formulations. Classified as a low Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance (HLB) emulsifier, EGDS is widely used as an opacifier and emulsion stabilizer in both oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) systems. Its effectiveness lies in its near insolubility in aqueous solutions, allowing it to contribute a creamy, pearlescent finish to personal care products such as shampoos, conditioners, lotions, creams, and body washes. EGDS appears as a white to cream-colored waxy solid and is soluble in hydrocarbons, esters, ketones, and chlorinated hydrocarbons, but insoluble in water. Its functionality extends to skin conditioning and thickening, enhancing the sensory profile of cosmetic products.</strong></p><p>
