</p><p>The increasing demand for high-performance filtration materials in water purification, biopharmaceutical processes, and industrial applications is a key driver of market growth. Additionally, advancements in membrane technology and the rising need for sustainable water treatment solutions are expected to propel market expansion.</p><p>
<strong>Market Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Polyethersulfone (PES) is a high-performance polymer widely used in membrane technology for various filtration applications. PES membranes are known for their superior thermal stability, mechanical strength, and excellent chemical resistance. These membranes are commonly employed in ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, and microfiltration processes, particularly in water treatment, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and food &amp; beverage industries. The hydrophilic nature of PES membranes provides enhanced permeability and minimal protein adsorption, making them an ideal choice for medical and industrial applications.</p><p>
