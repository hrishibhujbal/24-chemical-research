<h1>Plate Heat Exchanger Gasket Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Plate heat exchanger gaskets are critical components in heat exchange systems, serving as sealing elements between the individual plates of a plate heat exchanger (PHE). These gaskets ensure that the flow of fluids through the exchanger plates is contained and that the heat exchange process occurs efficiently without leakage. Plate heat exchangers are widely used in various industries, including chemical processing, HVAC systems, food and beverage, and more. The gaskets, typically made from rubber or elastomeric materials, play a vital role in maintaining the structural integrity and optimal functioning of the exchanger units. Their primary purpose is to maintain the pressure differential between the hot and cold fluids, preventing any cross-contamination or mixing of the fluids.</p><p>
