<h1>Polydextrose Powder Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Polydextrose is a synthetic polymer derived from glucose and used extensively in the food and beverage industry as a functional ingredient. It is primarily employed as a sugar, starch, and fat substitute. The compound is made through a process that involves dextrose (glucose), sorbitol (10%), and citric acid (1%). Known for its ability to mimic the properties of sugar, polydextrose serves as a humectant, stabilizer, and thickening agent in various food products.</p><p>
</p><p>Because of its high fiber content, polydextrose is classified as soluble fiber by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Health Canada, effective from April 2013. It is commonly used in low-carb, sugar-free, and diabetic recipes, aiming to improve the fiber content of foods while reducing calories and fats. It is a key ingredient in food products like beverages, baked goods, dairy items, breakfast cereals, puddings, and more.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
