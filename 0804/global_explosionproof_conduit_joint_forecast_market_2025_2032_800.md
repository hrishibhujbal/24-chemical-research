</p><p><strong>Explosion-proof conduit joint is an important component used to connect explosion-proof conduit systems, usually used to transmit electrical lines or signal lines in explosive environments. These joints are designed to be tightly sealed to prevent flammable gases or vapors from entering the interior of the duct system, thereby reducing the risk of explosion. Explosion-proof conduit joints usually have waterproof, dustproof, anti-corrosion, fireproof, high-temperature resistance and other properties to ensure safe operation in hazardous environments.</strong></p><p>
