</p><p>Seed coating polymers are specialized formulations applied to seeds to enhance their performance, protection, and overall agricultural productivity. These coatings are composed of polymeric materials that provide a protective layer around the seed, helping to deliver essential nutrients, pesticides, and biological agents that support germination, seedling establishment, and plant growth. The primary purpose of seed coating polymers is to improve seed handling, sowing efficiency, and resistance to environmental stressors such as pests, diseases, and adverse climatic conditions.</p><p>
</p><p>Seed coating polymers are widely used in various crop types, including cereals, pulses, vegetables, and oilseeds, catering to the needs of farmers for improved crop yield and sustainability. They also contribute to precision agriculture by ensuring uniform seed distribution, reducing seed wastage, and enhancing mechanized planting processes.</p><p>
