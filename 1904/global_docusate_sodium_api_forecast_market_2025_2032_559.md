</p><p>This growth is driven by the increasing demand for pharmaceutical excipients that enhance drug solubility and bioavailability, particularly in the formulation of oral liquid and solid dosage forms. Rising incidences of digestive disorders and growing awareness regarding effective treatment solutions further contribute to market expansion.</p><p>
</p><p>Docusate sodium is a pharmaceutical-grade surfactant commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as an excipient. It functions as a solubilizing agent, helping poorly soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) dissolve more effectively. Additionally, it serves as an emulsifying and dispersing agent in drug formulations, improving the bioavailability and consistency of medications. Docusate sodium is widely recognized for its role in stool softeners, aiding in the prevention and treatment of constipation by drawing water into the stool, making it easier to pass.</p><p>
