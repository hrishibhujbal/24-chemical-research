            https://www.24chemicalresearch.com/download-sample/290829/global-dental-plaster-forecast-market-2025-2031-458</a></b></div><br><p><strong>This reflects a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.2% over the forecast period (2024-2031),</strong> indicating strong and sustained demand. Several factors underpin this growth trajectory, including the expanding geriatric population, increased access to dental healthcare, and technological advancements in prosthodontics and orthodontics.</p><p>
</p><p>Historically, the market has seen moderate yet consistent growth, owing to its foundational role in dental restoration and impression-taking. The increased prevalence of dental caries, periodontal disease, and edentulism, particularly in aging populations, continues to drive product demand. Additionally, the rise in cosmetic dentistry, which heavily depends on accurate mold creation, is fueling the need for high-quality dental plasters globally.</p><p>
</p><p>Digital dentistry has somewhat altered traditional workflows; however, dental plaster remains a critical component for many practices that rely on hybrid techniques or lack access to fully digital infrastructure. Its affordability and ease of use keep it relevant, especially in emerging markets.</p><p>
</p><p>Dental plaster, commonly referred to as plaster of Paris within the dental industry, is a fine white powder made from calcined gypsum (calcium sulfate hemihydrate). It is primarily utilized for creating precise and durable molds, casts, and models of oral structures. When mixed with water, it forms a thick paste that hardens rapidly, offering a smooth and stable surface ideal for diagnostic and prosthetic purposes. Dental plaster is widely used by dental technicians and orthodontists in the fabrication of crowns, bridges, dentures, aligners, and surgical guides. It comes in multiple grades, each tailored for specific dental applications, including general modeling, articulating, and die production.</p><p>
</p><p>This versatile material offers excellent reproducibility, dimensional accuracy, and ease of manipulation, making it indispensable in dental laboratories and clinical settings. Additionally, dental plaster serves as a base material in educational demonstrations and dental training programs due to its cost-effectiveness and reliability.</p><p>
