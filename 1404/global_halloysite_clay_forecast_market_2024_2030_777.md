<h1>Halloysite Clay Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Halloysite clay is a naturally occurring aluminosilicate clay mineral characterized by its fine particle size and low impurity levels. It is widely utilized in various industrial applications, including high-grade ceramics, electric porcelain, crucibles, and refractory materials. Halloysite clay exists in a hydrated form, which, when heated to temperatures between 50-90Â°C, undergoes a transformation into a dehydrated state known as transformed halloysite.</p><p>
