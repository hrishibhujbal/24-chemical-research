</p><p>Styrene-Ethylene-Butadiene-Styrene (SEBS) is a high-performance thermoplastic elastomer that belongs to the family of block copolymers. It consists of polystyrene end-blocks and an ethylene-butene copolymer mid-block, providing a unique balance of flexibility, toughness, and durability. SEBS is derived from the hydrogenation of Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS), which enhances its resistance to heat, oxidation, and UV radiation, making it suitable for various applications such as medical devices, automotive components, adhesives, and consumer goods.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
