</p><p>Factors such as stricter environmental regulations favoring eco-friendly coatings and advancements in powder coating technologies contribute to this expansion.</p><p>
<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Heavy duty powder coating refers to a dry finishing process that is widely used for coating metal substrates. This coating is composed of polymer resin systems blended with curatives, pigments, leveling agents, flow modifiers, and other additives. The process involves electrostatic spray deposition (ESD), wherein the powder adheres to a metal surface and is then cured under heat to form a protective, durable finish. Heavy duty powder coatings are preferred due to their resistance to corrosion, chemicals, and harsh environmental conditions, making them ideal for applications in industries such as automotive, construction, and industrial equipment.</p><p>
<strong style="font-size:13px">Market Dynamics (Drivers, Restraints, Opportunities, and Challenges)</strong></p><p>
