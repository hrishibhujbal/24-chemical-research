</p><p><strong>North America’s Rubber Accelerator TP market size was recorded at USD 60.19 million in 2023, with a projected CAGR of 3.00% from 2025 to 2030. The market in this region is expected to grow steadily, driven by the high demand for automotive parts and other rubber-based components.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>The rubber accelerator market has been expanding in line with the increasing industrialization, technological advancements in rubber manufacturing processes, and the growing trend towards the adoption of more durable, high-performance materials. The increasing number of vehicles on the road and the rising need for construction materials are key factors contributing to the growth of this market.</p><p>
</p><p>Rubber Accelerator TP is a specialized chemical compound used in the production of rubber, particularly in the curing process of Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) rubber. This accelerator is made from a blend of sulfur, zinc oxide (ZnO), thiazoles, and thiurams. It plays a critical role in improving the cross-linking of rubber, which enhances its performance in various applications. The primary advantage of using Rubber Accelerator TP is its ability to promote a high degree of cross-linking without blooming, which is the undesirable formation of a surface deposit that can occur with other accelerators.</p><p>
