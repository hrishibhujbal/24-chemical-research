</p><p>Hard carbon, also referred to as "non-graphitizable carbon," is a specific category of carbon material known for its resistance to graphitization, even under extremely high temperatures exceeding 3000°C. Structurally, hard carbon is composed of randomly oriented and twisted graphene sheets, resulting in a disordered configuration that does not easily convert into crystalline graphite. This unique structural property makes hard carbon an ideal anode material in various energy storage devices, including lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), and supercapacitors.</p><p>
</p><p>As the demand for advanced energy storage solutions escalates across various industries – especially automotive, electronics, and renewable energy – hard carbon anodes have emerged as crucial components due to their superior electrochemical properties. These include high specific capacity, excellent cycling stability, and robust performance at low temperatures. In sodium-ion battery technology in particular, hard carbon anodes provide an effective alternative to graphite, which is less compatible with sodium ions.</p><p>
