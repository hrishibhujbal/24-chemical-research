</p><p><strong>Epoxidized Soybean Oil (ESBO) is manufactured from soybean oil through the process of epoxidation, making it a widely used plasticizer due to its high numbers of epoxidized carbon-carbon double bonds. The reactive nature of the epoxide group, stemming from the double bonds, makes ESBO an effective hydrochloric acid scavenger and plasticizer.</strong></p><p>
