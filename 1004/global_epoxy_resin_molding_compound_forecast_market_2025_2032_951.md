</p><p><strong>Epoxy Resin Molding Compound (EMC) refers to a type of thermosetting polymer used primarily for encapsulating semiconductor devices. These compounds provide mechanical support and environmental protection to sensitive electronic components. EMCs are vital in ensuring the durability and performance of devices such as mobile phones, televisions, industrial machinery, vehicles, and other consumer electronics. The epoxy compound, when cured, offers high-temperature resistance, excellent adhesion, and superior insulation properties. EMCs are generally composed of resin, hardeners, fillers, and additives, tailored to meet the specifications of diverse semiconductor applications. Their low moisture absorption and resistance to chemicals and thermal degradation make them indispensable in the semiconductor manufacturing process.</strong></p><p>
