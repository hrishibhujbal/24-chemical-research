<h1>Sodium Fluorosilicate Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p><strong>The global Sodium Fluorosilicate market was valued at US$ 118.3 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 157.9 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 4.2% during the forecast period.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Sodium fluorosilicate appears as white crystal, crystalline powder or colorless hexagonal crystals. It is odorless and tasteless. Its relative density is 2.68; it has moisture absorption capability. It can be dissolved in a solvent such as ethyl ether but insoluble in alcohol. The solubility in acid is greater than that in water. It can be decomposed in alkaline solution, generating sodium fluoride and silica. After searing (300 ?), it is decomposed into sodium fluoride and silicon tetrafluoride. It is poisonous.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
