<h1>Global Sodium Dehydroacetate Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>sodium dehydroacetate market</strong> is poised for significant expansion, projected to grow at a <strong>5.8% CAGR from 2024 to 2030</strong>, driven by its critical role as a preservative across food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. This synthetic compound's exceptional antifungal and antibacterial properties make it indispensable for extending product shelf life while meeting stringent safety regulations.</p><p><strong>1. Food Safety Regulations Intensify Demand:</strong><br>
With global food waste reaching <strong>1.3 billion tons annually</strong>, sodium dehydroacetate has become crucial for preservation. The compound's effectiveness at concentrations as low as <strong>0.1â0.3%</strong> makes it preferable for baked goods, sauces, and processed meats. Regulatory approvals from <strong>FDA, EFSA, and China's NHFPC</strong> continue to reinforce its adoption.</p><p><strong>2. Cosmetic Industry's Preservation Needs:</strong><br>
The <strong>US$ 380 billion global cosmetics industry</strong> increasingly relies on sodium dehydroacetate as paraben alternatives gain traction. Its compatibility with diverse pH ranges (3â9) and thermal stability up to <strong>120Â°C</strong> makes it ideal for creams, lotions, and haircare formulations. Major brands have incorporated it in <strong>43% of new preservative systems</strong> launched in 2023.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
