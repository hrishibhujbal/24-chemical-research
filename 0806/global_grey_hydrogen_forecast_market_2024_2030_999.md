<h1>Grey Hydrogen Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>grey hydrogen market</strong> is projected to expand significantly from 2024 to 2030, driven by established industrial demand despite growing environmental concerns. As the most widely produced form of hydrogen today, grey hydrogen remains integral to multiple sectors, though its carbon-intensive production is prompting strategic shifts across the value chain.</p><p>Grey hydrogen, derived primarily through <strong>steam methane reforming (SMR) of natural gas</strong> or coal gasification, accounts for approximately <strong>95% of current global hydrogen production</strong>. While cost-effective at $1-2/kg, each kilogram generates 9-12kg of COâ emissions, creating tension between economic pragmatism and decarbonization goals.</p><p><strong>1. Sustained Industrial Demand from Core Sectors:</strong><br>
The <strong>petrochemical industry</strong> consumes over 60% of grey hydrogen output, primarily for ammonia synthesis and oil refining. With global ammonia demand projected to grow at <strong>3.8% annually</strong> through 2030 for fertilizer production, existing infrastructure continues driving steady offtake despite environmental pressure.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

As nations navigate the energy transition, grey hydrogen serves as a <strong>bridge feedstock</strong> while green hydrogen capacity scales. The steel industry's gradual adoption of hydrogen-based direct reduced iron (DRI) processes has created 2.7 million ton/year incremental demand since 2021, with grey hydrogen meeting initial pilot-phase requirements.</p><p><strong>3. Regional Energy Security Dynamics:</strong><br>
Countries with abundant natural gas reserves like the U.S. and Russia maintain competitive grey hydrogen production costs below $1.50/kg. Recent geopolitical tensions have reinforced energy sovereignty concerns, with the EU temporarily easing carbon regulations to sustain <strong>4.1 million ton/year</strong> grey hydrogen capacity critical for chemical manufacturing.</p><p>Despite entrenched industrial reliance, the market faces mounting pressures:</p><p><strong>Carbon Pricing Impacts:</strong> The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) carbon prices exceeding â¬90/ton have increased grey hydrogen production costs by <strong>35-40%</strong> since 2021, accelerating corporate decarbonization roadmaps.</p><p><strong>Blue Hydrogen Competition:</strong> Over <strong>48 carbon capture projects</strong> targeting hydrogen production were announced in 2023 alone, threatening grey hydrogen's cost advantage in regions with carbon sequestration potential.</p><p><strong>Policy Phase-Outs:</strong> National hydrogen strategies in Germany, Canada and South Korea now mandate <strong>50-70% green hydrogen</strong> quotas in industrial applications by 2030, directly displacing grey hydrogen demand.</p><p><strong>1. Hybrid Production Systems:</strong><br>
Forward-thinking operators are integrating <strong>partial carbon capture</strong> (30-50% rates) at SMR facilities to create transitional "light blue" hydrogen, reducing emissions while maintaining 25% cost advantages over full CCS implementations.</p><p><strong>2. Industrial Cluster Approaches:</strong><br>
Regional hubs like Rotterdam and Houston are developing <strong>shared COâ infrastructure</strong>, enabling smaller grey hydrogen producers to participate in carbon capture networks previously only viable for mega-projects.</p><p><strong>3. Methane Pyrolysis Technology:</strong><br>
Emerging thermal decomposition processes can produce hydrogen from natural gas while capturing solid carbon rather than COâ. While currently at pilot scale, this could redefine grey hydrogen's environmental profile by 2028-2030.</p><p><strong>Diverging Regional Strategies:</strong><br>
	Asia continues expanding grey hydrogen capacity (China added <strong>1.2 million tons</strong> in 2023), while Europe actively decommissions legacy SMR plants in favor of imports and green hydrogen.</p><p><strong>Lifecycle Certification Systems:</strong><br>
	Voluntary schemes like the GHG Protocol's hydrogen methodology enable grey hydrogen producers to differentiate based on verified emission reductions along the value chain.</p><p><strong>Industrial Carbon Offsetting:</strong><br>
	Some manufacturers now pair grey hydrogen procurement with nature-based carbon credits to meet Scope 3 emission targets, creating hybrid sustainability claims.</p><p>The market features entrenched energy and industrial gas leaders including <strong>Linde plc, Air Liquide</strong>, and <strong>Air Products</strong>, which collectively control over 60% of merchant hydrogen supply. These companies are strategically repositioning â Linde now directs <strong>40% of R&amp;D</strong> toward transitional technologies like auto-thermal reforming with carbon capture.</p><p>Regional specialists like <strong>Messer</strong> and <strong>Iwatani Corporation</strong> maintain strongholds in local markets through reliability-focused operations and legacy infrastructure. Meanwhile, engineering firms like <strong>ThyssenKrupp</strong> are repurposing grey hydrogen expertise into clean hydrogen solutions.</p><p><strong>By Production Method:</strong></p><p><strong>By End-Use Industry:</strong></p><p><strong>North America:</strong> Leads in SMR efficiency with 80% capacity utilization, but faces carbon policy uncertainty.</p><p><strong>Europe:</strong> Accelerating phase-out with 12 SMR plant closures announced through 2027.</p><p><strong>Asia-Pacific:</strong> Growth epicenter adding 3.4 million tons/year new capacity by 2026.</p><p><strong>Middle East:</strong> Leveraging low-cost gas to maintain
